# Mailor

Mailor is a Python project aimed to provide all utilities related to mailing services.

As of right now, it is only capable of downloading all emails to your local computer, but eventually it will be a fully-functional web application that provides all sorts of mailing-related functionality.

To run the script, you will need to create a .env file and fill in the following fields:
- LOCAL_DOWNLOAD_PATH
- EMAIL_USERNAME
- EMAIL_PASSWORD
